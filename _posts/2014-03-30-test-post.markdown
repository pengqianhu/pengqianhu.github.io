You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

*Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight html %}
<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<div>
	<h3>This is h3</h3>
	<span>hello</span>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi~~, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
